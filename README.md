### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Project Engineer at the **Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Area of I2CAT Foundation**. I'm a **Telecommunication Engineer** by Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya, Telematics Speciality.

I have been mainly working in the AI area, including neural networks and convolutional neural networks applied to computer vision applications. I also have collaborated delivering a lecture about Artificial Intelligence on the Edge within the Internet of Thing(IoT) master at UPC School.

Currently, I'm coursing a master degree in Advanced Telecommunications Technologies while working in several projects in i2CAT, founded by Catalan institutions, European Union and private companies.
